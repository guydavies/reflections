When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?
  When you want to share your work with other users
  When you want other users to contribute to the work
Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If other people are making simultaneous changes, you might end up being unable to save and then resolve the changes.
